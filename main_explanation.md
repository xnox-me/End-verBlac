# Explanation of `main.py`

This Python script creates an interactive terminal where a user can type a prompt, and an AI model will generate a shell command based on that prompt. The script then executes the command and displays the output.

## Core Components:

1.  **`get_ai_command(prompt)`**: This function sends the user's prompt to the OpenAI API and returns a shell command generated by the specified AI model. It includes a system message to guide the AI to respond only with valid shell commands.

2.  **`execute_command(command)`**: This function takes the AI-generated command and executes it in a bash shell. It captures and returns the standard output and standard error.

3.  **`main()`**: This is the main function where the script's execution begins. It does the following:
    *   Initializes a list of available AI models with descriptions.
    *   Prompts the user to select a model.
    *   Enters a loop to continuously:
        *   Accept user input.
        *   Call `get_ai_command_with_model()` to get the AI-generated command.
        *   Log the user prompt and AI command to `chat_journal.txt`.
        *   Execute the command using `execute_command()`.
        *   Print the output and any errors.

## Feature Suggestions:

1.  **Command Confirmation**: Before executing the command, ask the user for confirmation. This would prevent the execution of unintended or potentially harmful commands.

2.  **Command History**: Implement a command history feature. Users could press the up and down arrow keys to navigate through previously entered commands.

3.  **Alias Support**: Allow users to create aliases for frequently used commands or prompts.

4.  **Context-Aware Conversations**: Improve the AI's context awareness. The AI could remember the context of the current session to provide more relevant commands in subsequent interactions. For example, if a user creates a directory and then wants to create a file, the AI should know to create the file in the newly created directory.

5.  **File Uploads for Context**: Allow users to upload files to provide more context to the AI. For example, a user could upload a source code file and ask the AI to generate a command to compile it.

6.  **Plugin System**: Develop a plugin system to extend the functionality. For example, a git plugin could add specialized commands for interacting with git repositories.

7.  **Customizable System Messages**: Allow users to customize the system message sent to the AI. This would enable them to tailor the AI's behavior to their specific needs.

8.  **Error Handling and Suggestions**: When a command fails, the AI could try to diagnose the error and suggest a corrected command.

9.  **Multi-line Command Support**: Allow users to input and execute multi-line scripts.

10. **Integration with Other Tools**: Integrate with other developer tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or specific cloud provider CLIs to provide a more seamless workflow.
